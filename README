SubdomainFu
=========

SubdomainFu provides a modern implementation of subdomain handling in Rails.
It takes aspects from account_location, request_routing, and other snippets
found around the web and combines them to provide a single, simple solution
for subdomain-based route management.

Configuration
=============

You may need to configure SubdomainFu based on your development setup. The
configuration required is:

tld_size
--------
A hash for each environment of the size of the top-level domain name. 
(something.com = 1, localhost = 0, etc.)

SubdomainFu.tld_size = 1 # sets for current environment
SubdomainFu.tld_sizes = {:development => 0,
                         :test => 0,
                         :production => 1} # set all at once (also the defaults)
                         
mirrors
-------

Mirrors are the subdomains that are equivalent to no subdomain (i.e. they 'mirror')
the usage of the root domain.

SubdomainFu.mirrors = %w(www site we) # Defaults to %w(www)

Examples
========

SubdomainFu works in both the URL writing parts of Rails and the routes. For
URL writing, it provides you an option you can pass into any URL-generating
call to use (or lose) a subdomain:

url_for(:controller => "my_controller", :action => "my_action", :subdomain => "awesome")
users_url(:subdomain => false) # specifying "false" will remove any current subdomain
