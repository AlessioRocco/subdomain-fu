SubdomainFu
=========

SubdomainFu provides a modern implementation of subdomain handling in Rails.
It takes aspects from account_location, request_routing, and other snippets
found around the web and combines them to provide a single, simple solution
for subdomain-based route management.

Example
=======

Feature Wishlist

* Link between subdomains via :subdomain option (with :subdomain => false corresponding to no subdomain)
* Route between subdomains, raise error on subdomain-requiring subdomains that don't have an subdomain

link_to "Some Subdomain Page", some_resources_path()
